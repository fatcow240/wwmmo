      <p>The colony ship is what you'll need to colonize remote planets. They'll carry 100 of
      your colony's population to a brave new world.</p>
      <p>Colony ships are single-use. The ship is destroyed once a planet is colonized.</p>

          The cryogenic chamber means colonists are put to sleep during the voyage to the next planet. This allows for
          a larger number of colonists to be deployed, increasing the number of initial colonists from 100 to 400.

    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>Scouts are small, fast ships with no attack capability (and not much in the way of
      defensive capabilities, either). What they <em>are</em> good at, though, is getting in
      and out of enemy starsystems and reporting back what they found.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          Adding a cloaking device to a scout makes it invisible to enemy radar. Additionally, if you set
          the scout's stance to "Neutral" or "Passive", it will remain <em>undetected</em> around enemy stars.

    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>Your basic fighter has average speed, low-grade weapons and low-grade shields. They
      make up for a general lack of firepower by being incredibly cheap to produce and
      fuel-efficient, allowing you to overwhealm your enemy with numbers.</p>

      transport ships throughout your empire.</p>
