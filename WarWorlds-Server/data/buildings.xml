      <p>The shipyard allows you to build ships.</p>
      <p>You can have only one shipyard on your planet, but it's efficiency and the range of
      ships available to you can be upgraded with the building of supporting buildings.</p>

      <p>The Silo allows you to store farming produce and minerals indefinitely. The higher the
      silo level, the more you can store. Silos store produce for all colonies in this starsystem
      and you can build as many as you like.</p>
      <p>A level 1 Silo adds 100 storage for minerals and goods. A level 2 Silo adds 210, level 3
      adds 330, a level 4 Silo adds 460, and a level 5 Silo adds 600.</p>
