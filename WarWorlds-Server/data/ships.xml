      <p>The colony ship is what you'll need to colonize remote planets. They'll carry 100 of
      your colony's population to a brave new world.</p>
      <p>Colony ships are single-use. The ship is destroyed once a planet is colonized. <i>Be
      aware that once your ship is built, 100 population will be removed from your colony and
      added to the ship!</i></p>

      <p>Scouts are small, fast ships with no attack capability (and not much in the way of
      defensive capabilities, either). What they <em>are</em> good at, though, is getting in
      and out of enemy starsystems and reporting back what they found.</p>
