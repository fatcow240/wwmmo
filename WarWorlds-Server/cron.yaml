# The star simulator runs every 6 hours and makes sure that no star is more than
# 18 hours out of date. The stars "predict" 24 hours into the future, and in this way
# we'll always have accurate estimates for the end time of build jobs, we'll know when
# populations drop below certain levels, etc.
# It also means we don't have possible un-bounded re-simulate times when viewing stars
