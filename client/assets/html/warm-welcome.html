<p>Welcome to War Worlds, a new 4X MMO for Android, in the spirit of Master of Orion!</p>

<p>If you are new to this kind of game, you might want to become familiar with the idea of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X gaming</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO gaming</a> as well.</p>

<p>For now, let's just say this is a game of galactic space war, played online by hundreds of players at a time.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll be asked to do is set up your Empire. We'll need to authenticate you with a
Google Account, and then a couple of basic questions about who you want to be in the game, 
and that is all that is required.</p>
